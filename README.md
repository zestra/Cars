# Zestras-Space-Invaders
Welcome to my version of Space Invaders!

I should give credit to [seanmtracey](https://github.com/seanmtracey) for borrowing the spacecraft images from his [book](https://github.com/seanmtracey/Games-with-Pygame).
(I'm not a great artist you see...)

## by the way...
I have now successfully committed draft 6 and more, and so this directory is up to date, and all the features listed below are included.
And, I would like to note that unless you don't understand what I mean by "successfully committed", it is because I had a problem commiting files before, and now it works properly.
